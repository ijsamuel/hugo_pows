Welcome to my site on my book. I have details here regarding my book and also a link to my personal blog.

Pearls of Wisdom is a collection of short stories that illustrate key verses from the book of Proverbs, written by the wisest man that lived in the world, King Solomon. Each story enhances the meaning of the proverb. The interpretation of each proverb is the authorâ€™s but tries to capture the essence of the proverb and the lesson that King Solomon is trying to convey.

See blog posts below.
