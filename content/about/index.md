{{< figure src="/images/author.jpg" alt="James Samuel" >}}

James Samuel was born in India and came to the United States at a young age. _Pearls of Wisdom_ is his first book. James loves to read and grew up hearing Bible stories and Indian folk tales. He is especially influenced by the Book of Proverbs which his mother told him to read daily.

Over the years, _Pearls of Wisdom_ was formed with inspiration from God, as James would tell short stories to his children based on Proverbs. James attended MIT and completed his MBA from NYU. He lives with his family in Connecticut.
